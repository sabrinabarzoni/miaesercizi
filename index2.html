                <h2>The SVG Element</h2>
                <P>The HTML SVG element is a container for SVG graphics.SVG has several methods for drawing paths,
                    rectangles, circles, polygons, text, and much more.</P>

                <h2>Differences Between SVG and Canvas</h2>
                <p>SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML, while Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with
                    JavaScript).

                    SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach
                    JavaScript event handlers to SVG graphics.

                    In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the
                    browser can automatically re-render the shape.

                    Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the
                    browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any
                    objects that might have been covered by the graphic.</p>
